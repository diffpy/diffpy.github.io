DiffPy - Atomic Structure Analysis in Python
============================================
A free and open source software project to provide python software for
diffraction analysis and the study of the atomic structure of materials.

The project is currently maintained by the Billinge Group and DiffPy community members.

Many parts of the code were developed under the diffraction part of the DANSE_ project,
a software construction project funded by the `National Science Foundation`_ to provide
data analysis software tools for neutron scattering experiments. The DiffPy project has 
been a collaborative effort, centered in many institutions, including Brookhaven National
Laboratory, Columbia University, and Michigan State University.

DiffPy is the home of a number of software products for atomic structure
analysis. A large portion of the DiffPy project consists of tools for atomic pair
distribution function (PDF) analysis. For detailed instructions
and in-depth examples of modeling Pair Distribution Function data, we highly recommend the book,


*Atomic Pair Distribution Function Analysis: A Primer* by Simon J. L. Billinge and Kirsten M. Ø. Jensen (Oxford University Press, 2023).


To purchase this book, please visit `this link <https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Pair-Distribution-Function-Analysis/dp/0198885806>`_.

The DiffPy project is also home to many other software tools for analysis of scientific data. 
One of which is diffpy.cmi, a general-purpose
complex modeling infrastructure for analysis of *any* type of data.
For more information about diffpy.cmi, please visit the
`diffpy.cmi documentation <https://www.diffpy.org/diffpy.cmi>`_.
