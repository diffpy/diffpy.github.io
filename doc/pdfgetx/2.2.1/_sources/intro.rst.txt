Introduction
========================================================================

diffpy.pdfgetx is a simple yet powerful software for converting X-ray or
neutron powder diffraction data to atomic Pair Distribution Functions
(PDFs). In addition, it also allows the extraction of PDFs from small-angle
scattering (SAS) data. The software includes three command line programs
PDFgetX3, PDFgetN3 and PDFgetS3 for processing X-ray,
constant-wavelength neutron and small-angle diffraction data
respectively. PDFgetX3, PDFgetN3 and PDFgetS3 can be used in a batch
mode to convert a series of data files without user intervention. The
programs can be also run in an interactive mode that allows to control
process parameters and plot the PDFs and any intermediate results. Users
can interactively tune the PDF processing parameters, visualize their effect on the results and adjust them to their optimum values. The programs are bundled with Python library diffpy.pdfgetx for PDF processing functions, which can be used in custom Python scripts.
