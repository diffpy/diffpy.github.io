======================      ============================================
Module                      Description
======================      ============================================
`diffpy.srfit`_             Setup and control of general fitting
                            problems.

`diffpy.srmise`_            Python tool for peak extraction and peak
                            fitting of atomic pair distribution
                            functions.

`diffpy.srreal`_            Python library for calculation of pair based
                            quantities such as the pair distribution
                            function (PDF), bond lengths, and bond
                            valence sums.

`diffpy.Structure`_         Handles storage of crystal structure data.

`diffpy.utils`_             General purpose shared utilities for the
                            diffpy libraries.

`pyobjcryst`_               Python bindings to the ObjCryst++
                            Object-Oriented Crystallographic
                            Library.

`diffpy.pdffit2`_           Atomic structure refinement and PDF fitting
                            (this is the computational engine used by
                            PDFgui).

`diffpy.mpdf`_              Tools for calculating and refining magnetic
                            PDFs.


`diffpy.mappdf`_            Tools for High Throughput data fitting and
                            visualization.
