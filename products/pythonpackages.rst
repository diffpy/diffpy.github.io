Python Packages
===============

This is a complete list of all Python packages developed by the DiffPy
team. For more information about a specific package, follow the link to
the corresponding github page. With the exception of PDFfit2 and SrMise
all of the packages listed below are bundled in the |DiffPyCMI| release.

======================      ============================================
Module                      Description
======================      ============================================
`diffpy.srfit`_             Setup and control of general fitting
                            problems.

`diffpy.srmise`_            Python tool for peak extraction and peak
                            fitting of atomic pair distribution
                            functions.

`diffpy.srreal`_            Python library for calculation of pair based
                            quantities such as the pair distribution
                            function (PDF), bond lengths, and bond
                            valence sums.

`diffpy.Structure`_         Handles storage of crystal structure data.

`diffpy.utils`_             General purpose shared utilities for the
                            diffpy libraries.

`pyobjcryst`_               Python bindings to the ObjCryst++
                            Object-Oriented Crystallographic
                            Library.

`diffpy.pdffit2`_           Atomic structure refinement and PDF fitting
                            (this is the computational engine used by
                            PDFgui).
