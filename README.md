# GitHub Structure

This repository contains 3 branches:

1. [`source`][source] sphinx sources for the web page
2. [`master`][master] sources compiled to HTML format that are published via GitHub pages
3. [`archive`][archive] converted subversion repository for the old diffpy.org sources

The basic logic is we edit on the source branch and follow instructions below to build the
sources.  The built sources, in the form of html files, are then copied to the master branch
which is what GitHub pages is configured to render.

# Publishing New Version of an Existing Project

For releasing an updated version of a project, first generate the release for the project and 
make sure it is successfully deployed at Pypi and conda-forge.

If you would like to see Connor's commented out comments about how to link pdf versions of
documentation manuals please see the raw source code of this readme.  However, we are moving
away from having separately built manuals.
<!--
In what follows, [pdfgetx v2.1.1](https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.pdfgetx/releases/tag/v2.1.1) was chosen to show example commands for the steps outlined.

After following the steps necessary for releasing your project, grab the set of documentation that
will be provided with the deliverable upon user's request (typically, this would be something like
the files hosted by GitHub on the GitHub releases page). Create a new directory for the updated
version's documentation to live in
```
diffpy.github.io (source)$ mkdir static_root/doc/pdfgetx/2.1.1
```
Copy the updated documentation to this directory
```
diffpy.github.io (source)$ tar --directory=static_root/doc/pdfgetx/2.1.1/ \
                               --strip-components=4 \
                               -vxzf ~/Downloads/diffpy.pdfgetx-2.1.1.tar.gz \
                               diffpy.pdfgetx-2.1.1/doc/manual/_build/PDFgetXNS3_manual.pdf

diffpy.github.io (source)$ tar --directory=static_root/doc/pdfgetx/2.1.1/ \
                               --strip-components=5 \
                               --exclude=objects.inv \
                               --exclude=.buildinfo \
                               -vxzf ~/Downloads/diffpy.pdfgetx-2.1.1.tar.gz \
                               diffpy.pdfgetx-2.1.1/doc/manual/_build/html/

diffpy.github.io (source)$ cp ~/Downloads/pdfgetxn3-examples.zip \
                              static_root/doc/pdfgetx/2.1.1/
```
Make sure to include all relevant files (e.g., `PDFgetXNS3_manual.pdf` and `pdfgetxn3-examples.zip`),
exclude any files we don't want to provide to the user (e.g., `objects.inv` and `.buildinfo` from
`diffpy.pdfgetx-2.1.1.tar.gz`)
-->

With the [`source` branch][source] checed out, edit the landing page of your project] (e.g., 
`products/pdfgetx.rst` for PDFgetx3) to document and provide the updated version of your project.

Once the preceding steps are complete, see
the instructions of the [Publishing Changes](#submitting-changes) section for publishing these changes.

# Where to Make Changes

Here is a brief map of where in the sources to make updates when different things happen

## A new paper has appeared describing a diffpy product

<a name="reference-section-1"></a>
### Adding Publications that Describe a DiffPy Project (the "Reference" Section)

When adding a new publication to the list of [references used within the website](https://www.diffpy.org/publications.html), add the 
citation text of the publication to the documentation *only once* as a named snippet in 
[abbreviations.txt](https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.github.io/blob/source/abbreviations.txt#L286). For example:
```
.. |citeJuhasJac18| replace::
   P. Juh√°s, J. N. Louwen, L. van Eijck, E. T. C. Vogt, S. J. L. Billinge,
   `PDFgetN3: atomic pair distribution functions from
   neutron powder diffraction data using ad hoc corrections
   <https://doi.org/10.1107/S1600576718010002>`__,
   *J. Appl. Crystallogr.*, **51**, 1492--1497 (2018)
   |downloadJuhasJac18|
```
Here, `|citeJuhasJac18|` is the name that can be used elsewhere in the documentation and 
the Sphinx documentation generator will replace all instances of this tag with the indented 
text following the `replace::` directive.

**Important:** After defining the publication's tag as described above, make sure to add the
publication to the list of publications maintained in [publications.rst](https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.github.io/blob/source/publications.rst). Make sure that
you add the reference to the proper section and do so in descending reverse chronological order
(i.e., the newest citations should appear at the top of their respective sections).

<a name="reference-section-note">*Note:*</a> In this example, the citation is for a publication 
which describes a product of the DiffPy-CMI project (namely, PDFgetN3). For publications which 
describe a component of DiffPy-CMI, we provide a link to download the publication directly from
the [diffpy.org][site] website. Here, the link is provided via the `|downloadJuhasJac18|` tag
which is the identifier for another snippet within [abbreviations.txt](https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.github.io/blob/source/abbreviations.txt#L294) following the definition
of `|citeJuhasJac18|`, seen here as:
```
.. |downloadJuhasJac18| image:: /images/pdficon_small.png
   :target: /doc/pdfgetx/Juhas-jac-2018.pdf
```
Furthermore, note that since the initial use of `|downloadJuhasJac18|` occurs within the indented text
of the definition of `|citeJuhasJac18|`, the link to `|downloadJuhasJac18|` will appear
everywhere `|citeJuhasJac18|` does.

Lastly, make sure that the linked publication has been included within this project's files, placed in
an appropriate directory (typically, the parent directory of the project that the paper relates to). In
the above example, the publication covers the PDFgetN3 feature of the `pdfgetx` package, thus it is 
placed within `pdfgetx`'s documentation directory and referenced accordingly with the line
```
   :target: /doc/pdfgetx/Juhas-jac-2018.pdf
```


<a name="reference-section-2"></a>
### Adding Other Publications (the "Publication Using DiffPy-CMI" Section)

Adding references to publications that do not describe the release/use of a product within the DiffPy-CMI 
project (e.g., papers which use some component of DiffPy-CMI), we simply provide the usual citation text (with
appropriate DOI link). To add a citation of this type, refer to the information in [Reference Section](#reference-section-1), but
disregard everything starting at, and following, the [Note](#reference-section-note).


# Publishing New Project

For adding a new project to the website, see one of the existing projects (e.g., [pdfgetx](https://www.diffpy.org/products/pdfgetx.html)) as a reference.

You will need to create a directory for the project to live in within (e.g., [/static_root/doc/pdfgetx](https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.github.io/tree/source/static_root/doc/pdfgetx)), then
write a landing page for the project (e.g., [/products/pdfgetx.rst](https://github.com/diffpy/diffpy.github.io/blob/source/products/pdfgetx.rst)) which will provide any necessary information
or files needed for a user to use the project. Once this is complete, see 
[Publishing New Version of Existing Project](#new-version) for steps on publishing the project.


# Publishing Changes

In order to test and/or publish changes, activate a conda environment that has a working installation of Sphinx

## Testing Changes

With your sphinx containing env activated, run the set of Sphinx validation command(s) to check that the static
files that Sphinx will create to be served on the website are written properly:
```
diffpy.github.io (source)$ make linkcheck SPHINXOPTS="-W"
```
*NOTE:* the `"-W"` flag forces warnings to be treated as errors. If you believe there is a falsely reported
warning that should be ignored that is preventing the test from passing, rerun the above command with the
`SPHINXOPTS="-W"` portion omitted.  Note that on Windows this seemed to generate a number of warnings
not seen on linux and which didn't indicate anything broken.

Additionally, one can visually/user-experience validate that the changes are what is expected by running:
```
diffpy.github.io (source)$ make html
```
Then opening `/_build/html/index.html` which will open a local instance of the website with the proposed changes
in place.

## Maintainers (Publishing Changes)

First, follow the steps outlines in [Testing Changes](#testing-changes). Note that these tests, as they currently exist, are
not extensive and it's quite possible that something indeed may appear incorrectly on the website (hence the manual
review portion). After reviewing the changes, have Sphinx generate the static files to be hosted on the website:
```
diffpy.github.io (source)$ make html
```

Note: this could not be run by successfully by simon on Git Bash.  It can presumably be run from WSL?
Prepare the changes to be published:
```
diffpy.github.io (source)$ make publish-prepare
```

Finally, publish the changes:
```
diffpy.github.io (source)$ make publish-push
```
