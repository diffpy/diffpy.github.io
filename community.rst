To ensure a bright future for the DiffPy project it is essential to build a strong community
of users and contributing developers. News about updates and new releases will be made at the
`diffpy-users <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/diffpy-users>`__ Google group,
as well as it being a place to ask questions
and find answers about using all diffpy programs.
